Why would the Replay Officials recommend overturning the touchdown and simultaneously awarding a penalty in this situation?\nA) The offensive player's action of stepping out of bounds nullifies the touchdown if they did not reestablish their position in bounds before catching the ball.\nB) The defensive player's pass interference is a penalizable offense, which would typically result in a penalty against the defense.\nC) The Replay Officials detected a technical issue with the play clock, which is unrelated to the infractions identified.\nD) The touchdown is confirmed, but the penalty for pass interference is enforced on the subsequent kickoff.",
