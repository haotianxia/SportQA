Dataset for Paper "SportQA: A Benchmark for Sports Understanding in Large Language Models"

Each level includes three files: data, dev, and test. The test folder includes questions that we tested in the paper, while the dev folder is used to generate 5-shot and 5-shot CoT experiments. The data folder contains all questions that were not tested but can be further used as training data. All tasks are split into these three parts and distributed in the corresponding folders. For level 3, all questions are formatted in data and test files by using labels to distinguish different tasks.

We actively keep adding more questions.
